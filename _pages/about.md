This is Dr. He home on the web.

I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, robust machine learning, trustworthy AI, and their applications in decision and control for autonomous driving and robotics. My vision is to enable machines to reach or even surpass humans in terms of intelligence, safety, robustness and trustworthiness, through theoretical, applied and interdisciplinary research.
